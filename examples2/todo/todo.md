This is a temporary file. It will be deleted once all libui-functions and functionality is documented in the parent directory.

I am using it just to document some findings, some missing entries, and also when something is not clear to me.

Once we have achieved 100% implementation in the parent directory called examples2/, this todo-file should be removed, so this is just a temporary file. (In case we can not remove something due to not being implementable, I would propose to integrate this into some toplevel documentation for ruby-libui.)
